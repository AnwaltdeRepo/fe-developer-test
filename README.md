# Task description
Provide a dashboard including the following boxes:

- latest posts
- my todo's (should only show todo's of a specific user id)

You can find a simple wire frame in this repository (wireframe.png) to get an impression how it could look like.

# Conditions
- Implementation has to be responsive
- Tests should exist

# APIs
Since we're interested in your front end skills it is not necessary to implement an own API.
You can use those public endpoints
- https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/posts
- https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/todos

Please note: To access those APIs you need an access token which you can get here: https://gorest.co.in
Feel free to use either REST or GraphQL.

# Environment
- Docker as container management tool can be used but it's not a must
- Implementation is in vue3
- use Tailwind CSS

# Project delivery
- Project must have clear instructions on how to set up, install dependencies and run
- Git should be used as a VCS. Please send us the link to the repository or a zip-file
- Feel free to ask questions regarding the requirements
